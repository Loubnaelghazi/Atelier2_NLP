# Atelier2_NLP
This repository contains the code and report for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) lab aimed at familiarizing students with rule-based NLP techniques, regular expressions (Regex), and various word embedding approaches.
# NLP Lab: Rule-based NLP, Regex, and Word Embedding

## Objective
The main objective of this lab is to gain familiarity with rule-based NLP, Regex, and various word embedding techniques including one hot encoding, bag of words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec (Skip Gram, CBOW), Glove, and FastText. 

## Work Overview
### Part 1: Rule-Based NLP and Regex
In this part, we implemented a Python code that generates a bill from a given text using Regex. The text provided by the user contains information about purchased items along with their quantities and prices. The code extracts this information using regular expressions and generates a formatted bill.

### Part 2: Word Embedding
1. **One Hot Encoding, Bag of Words, TF-IDF**: Applied these techniques on the data vectors collected during the lab.
2. **Word2Vec, Glove, and FastText**: Utilized various word embedding approaches on the same DataSet.
3. **Plotting and Evaluation**: Visualized all the encoded/vectorized vectors using Tsne Algorithm and evaluated the effectiveness of each approach.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, we gained practical experience in implementing rule-based NLP techniques using Regex and explored various word embedding techniques. We found that while rule-based NLP can be effective for specific tasks like generating bills, word embedding techniques offer powerful tools for capturing semantic relationships and contextual information in text data. Overall, this lab provided valuable insights into the diverse methods available for processing and analyzing text data in NLP applications.
